	Master Mode for Hardcore AIO:

		Install:	Copy "zzzzzzzzzzzz_MHM_CampfireSaves.pak" to "~mods"

	Reshade Color Fix/Gloom:
		Desc:		ReShade is a post-processing injector for games and video software that enhances visuals 
				by adding effects like color correction, depth of field, and ambient occlusion. It allows 
				users to customize the appearance of their games through shaders and presets.

				In the case of MHM, two presets are available, and both depend on having reshade installed.
				There are also multiple presets for S2 available on Nexus Mods.

		For:		Any
		Install:	There are two options in MHM AIO, use only one:
					Color Grading Fix:	Copy "MHM.ini" to "~your game dir~\Stalker2\Binaries\Win64" folder
					Gloom:			Copy "MHMGloom.ini" to "~your game dir~\Stalker2\Binaries\Win64" folder

				Now to install reshade itself:
				Download ReShade from "https://reshade.me/#download" and run the installer.
				Point it to your "Stalker2.exe"
				Select the DirectX 10/11/12 option.
				Click uncheck all at the top right (Standard effects will stay checked, that's ok)
				At the bottom click "browse" and point it to the ini file you installed earlier.
				Click "next".
				Don't check anything on next screen, and click "next".
				Click "finish"
				Once ingame, press the "home" key on your keyboard.
				Click "Settings" tab at top.
				Under "General" section, check "Load only enabled effects"
				Pres "home" on your keyboard again to close the window.
				You will need to close and restart your game for everything to work properly.

	MHM Less Clear Weather, More Emission:
		Desc:		Far less clear weather, much more and longer lasting fog/cloud/rain
		For:		Any
				Requires Dynamic Weather Overhaul (See part 3, "MHM Recommended Mods" for installation).
		Install:	Copy "zzz_DWO_WeatherPatterns_MHMEdit_P.pak" to "~mods"
				If you already have DWO installed, delete "zz_DWO_WeatherPatterns_P.pak" from "~mods" (if it
				exists), as this file ~replaces~ it.

	Relaxed Mode for Standard AIO:

				Tones things down a bit for easier game.
