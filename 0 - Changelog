2025-03-20:  Clarified information about "Simple Mod Manager"

2025-03-21:  Added "4 - The Mods Folder" which contains info about what should/can be in your mods folder.

2025-03-25:  * All parts - Lots of small fixes/clarifications/typo/spelling
             * Parts 2/3 - Made information agnostic as to whether you use AIO or Modules
             * Part 3 - Added important information about unsupported mods             
             * Part 4 - Combined pak/ucas/utoc lines to eliminate duplicate information cluttering up the place
             * Part 5 - Major reformat

2025-03-25:  * Parts 1 and 4 are now updated for MHM 2.0.8 (Instructions remain the same for parts 2 and 3).
             * Moved MinUI Suite of mods to "No Longer Recommended", as the new UI update in MHM 2.0.8 is superior

2025-03-26:  * Update Part 5. Check it out.

2025-03-26:  * Updated parts 3 and 4 to include "Feliche's Weapon Position" as recommended mod.
             * Additions and shuffling of part 5.

2025-03-27:  * Big changes to formatting, added tables of contents, more defined section headers, spelling, etc
             * Lots of changes in particular to recommended mods
             * Re-done the chart in part 4, hopefully it is more clear now

2025-03-27:  * Move "Improved Saves Modular" to "Not Currently Recommended (Has Compatibility/Technical Issues)",
               until I can sort out the issue of not being able to make new manual saves, only overwrite.

2025-03-27:  * Move "Improved Saves Modular" back to (wholeheartedly) recommended.
               Insanely quick response and fix by the mod author.
