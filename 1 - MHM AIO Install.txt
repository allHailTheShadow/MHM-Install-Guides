===== MHM AIO Base Setup =====

CAUTION:
	I have no official association or contact with the mod author.
	These guides are UNOFFICIAL.


Base setup info:
	This is my attempt to get users up and going with a baseline install of MHM AIO.
	Vortex is not recommended.
	Go slowly, take your time, don't rush it, or do it if you are tired or frustrated.
	Don't worry about adding other mods yet, until you can get the base setup up and going.
	Use a new save.
	Create "~mods" folder in "S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 Heart of Chornobyl\Stalker2\Content\Paks" if it doesn't already exist.
	If it does exist, delete anything in there, and start fresh.


MHM AIO Part A:
	Download the "A - Modular Hard Mode - AIO" main file
	
	Copy the three "zzzzzzz_MHMTextures0z_P*" files to "~mods" folder
	Copy the three "zzzzzzz_MHM_Interface0z_P*" files to "~mods" folder
	Copy the three "LocalizationDB*" files from "Localization\Real Weapon Names Global" to "~mods" folder

	Choose either:
		Hardcore: From "A. Hardcore AIO" copy "zzzzzzz_MHM_2.0_AIO_Full_Hardcore.pak" to "~mods"
		--OR--
		Standard: From "B. Standard AIO" copy "zzzzzzz_MHM_2.0_AIO_Full_Standard.pak" to "~mods"

	For a basic setup, you won't need any of the files in "Patches & addons" (these are covered in parts 2 and 3)

	Note: You should now have 10 files in "~mods" folder

MHM AIO Part B:
	Download the "B - AIO Part II - Additional Resources" main file

	Note: you may wish to backup the existing files in this directory first
	Copy the files to "<YOUR GAME DIR>\Stalker2\Content\Movies\MainMenuVideo" and overwrite the existing files.


Required Mods:
	Faction Patches
		https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/721?tab=files
		Download the "FactionPatch" main file
		Copy the three "zz_FactionsPatch_Textures*" files to "~mods"

	LNA:
		https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/1212
		Download ~only~ the "1.LNA - Linxz's NPC Attachments" main file (Not needed desolation or vanilla file)
		Copy "LNA01_99_P.pak" to "~mods"

		IMPORTANT: Only the "LNA01_99_P.pak" file from this mod is needed. NO OTHER FILES.

	Mutant Loot:
		https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/389
		Download the "MutantLoot" main file
		Copy the three "ZZ_Mutant_Loot_Textures_P*" files to "~mods"

	OXA:
		https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/939?tab=description
		Download the "OXA - Oxide's eXpanded Armory" main file
		Copy ~all~ files to "~mods" --EXCEPT-- the three localization files and OXA03_P.pak
		
		IMPORTANT: Do NOT install OXA03_P.pak

	Project Itemization:
		https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/445
		Download the "Project Itemization" main file
		Copy the three "ZZZ_ProjectItemization-Textures_P*" files to "~mods"

	Simple Mod Loader:
		https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/304?tab=files
		Download the "SimpleModLoader" main file
		Copy all four files from "Stalker2\Content\Paks" to "~mods"
		Mod installation instructions specify to place it in "\Paks", rather than "\Paks\~mods"
		It should work either way, and at this stage be considered a user preference.
		If you need to load a mod with "mod add /Game/Mods/~~whatever~~/ModActor.ModActor_C" and it doesn't work, you could try moving SMM to "\Paks".


Your mods folder:
	For a standard MHM AIO setup, without additional mods/addons/patches your "~mods" folder should contain ~ONLY~ the following:
		LNA01_99_P.pak
		LocalizationDB_P.pak     (from MHM_AIO, not from any other mod)
		LocalizationDB_P.ucas    (from MHM_AIO, not from any other mod)

IMPORTANT
	Make double sure that you have ~NOT~ installed any of LNA file other than "LNA01_99_P.pak"
	Make double sure that you have ~NOT~ installed "OXA03_P.pak" from OXA


Final Step:
	Press tilde(~) ingame and enter the command "mod add /Game/Mods/OXA0X/ModActor.ModActor_C" without the quotes
	Above command only needed if updating MHM setup. Shouldn't be needed for new save (but it won't hurt either)
