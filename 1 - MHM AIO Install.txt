=========
01 - Info
=========
	This get you up and going with a baseline install of MHM AIO.
	Vortex is not recommended.
	Go slowly, take your time, don't rush it, or do it if you are tired or frustrated.
	Don't worry about adding other mods yet, until you can get the base setup up and going.
	Use a new game - don't add this to an existing save.


===============
02 - First Step
===============
	Create "~mods" folder in "<Your Stalker 2 Game Dir>\Stalker2\Content\Paks" if it doesn't already exist.
	If it does exist, delete anything in there, and start fresh.


====================
03 - MHM AIO, Part A
====================
	Download the "A - Modular Hard Mode - AIO" main file and:
		Copy the three "zzzzzzz_MHMTextures0z_P*" files to "~mods" folder
		Copy the three "zzzzzzz_MHM_Interface0z_P*" files to "~mods" folder
		Copy the three "LocalizationDB*" files from "Localization\Real Weapon Names Global" to "~mods" folder

	Choose one of Hardcore or Standard (not both, not neither)
		Hardcore: From "A. Hardcore AIO" copy "zzzzzzz_MHM_2.0_AIO_Full_Hardcore.pak" to "~mods"
		Standard: From "B. Standard AIO" copy "zzzzzzz_MHM_2.0_AIO_Full_Standard.pak" to "~mods"

	For a basic setup, you won't need any of the files in "Patches & addons" (these are covered in parts 2 and 3)

	Note: You should now have 10 files in "~mods" folder


====================
04 - MHM AIO, Part B
====================
	Note: you may wish to backup the existing files first
	
	Download the "B - AIO Part II - Additional Resources" main file
	Copy the files to "<YOUR GAME DIR>\Stalker2\Content\Movies\MainMenuVideo" and overwrite the existing files.


==================
05 - Required Mods
==================
	These are all required. Follow instructions carefully.

	Faction Patches
		https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/721
		Download the "FactionPatch" main file
		Copy the three "zz_FactionsPatch_Textures*" files to "~mods"

	LNA:
		https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/1212
		Download ~only~ the "1.LNA - Linxz's NPC Attachments" main file (Not needed desolation or vanilla file)
		Copy "LNA01_99_P.pak" to "~mods"

		IMPORTANT: Only the "LNA01_99_P.pak" file from this mod is needed. NO OTHER FILES.

	Mutant Loot:
		https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/389
		Download the "MutantLoot" main file
		Copy the three "ZZ_Mutant_Loot_Textures_P*" files to "~mods"

	OXA:
		https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/939
		Download the "OXA - Oxide's eXpanded Armory" old file (not main), version 2.2.0 for now.
		Newest version is 2.2.1, but not currently recommended by AniHVX for MHM.
		Copy ~all~ files to "~mods" --EXCEPT-- the three localization files and OXA03_P.pak
		
		IMPORTANT: Do NOT install OXA03_P.pak.

	Project Itemization:
		https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/445
		Download the "Project Itemization" main file
		Copy the three "ZZZ_ProjectItemization-Textures_P*" files to "~mods"

	Simple Mod Loader:
		https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/304
		Download the "SimpleModLoader" main file
		Copy all four files from "Stalker2\Content\Paks" to "~mods"
		Mod installation instructions specify to place it in "\Paks", rather than "\Paks\~mods"
		It should work either way, and at this stage be considered a user preference.
		If you need to load a mod with "mod add /Game/Mods/~~whatever~~/ModActor.ModActor_C" and it doesn't work, you could try moving SMM to "\Paks".


=========================
06 - Mods Folder Contents
=========================
	For a standard MHM AIO setup, without any of the official addons, or recommended mods, your "~mods" folder should contain --ONLY-- the following:

		LNA01_99_P				(pak)
		LocalizationDB_P			(pak,ucas,utoc)		<-- (from MHM_AIO, not from any other mod)
		zzzzzzz_MHMTextures0z_P			(pak,ucas,utoc)
		zzzzzzz_MHM_Interface0z_P		(pak,ucas,utoc)
		OXA0X					(pak,ucas,utoc)

		zzzzzzz_MHM_2.0_AIO_Full_Standard	(pak)
			--OR--
		zzzzzzz_MHM_2.0_AIO_Full_Hardcore	(pak)


================
07 - Final Steps
================
	Make double sure that you have ~NOT~ installed any of LNA file other than "LNA01_99_P.pak"
	Make double sure that you have ~NOT~ installed "OXA03_P.pak" from OXA
	Press tilde(~) ingame and enter the command "mod add /Game/Mods/OXA0X/ModActor.ModActor_C" without the quotes
	Above command only needed if updating MHM setup. Shouldn't be needed for new save (but it won't hurt either)
