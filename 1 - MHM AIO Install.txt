===== MHM AIO Base Setup =====

CAUTION:
	I have no official association or contact with the mod author.
	These guides are UNOFFICIAL.


Base setup info:
	This is my attempt to get users up and going with a baseline install of MHM AIO.
	Vortex is not recommended.
	Go slowly, take your time, don't rush it, or do it if you are tired or frustrated.
	Don't worry about adding other mods yet, until you can get the base setup up and going.
	Use a new save.
	Create "~mods" folder in "S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 Heart of Chornobyl\Stalker2\Content\Paks" if it doesn't already exist.
	If it does exist, delete anything in there, and start fresh.


MHM AIO:
	Download the "Modular Hard Mode - AIO" file
	Copy the three "MHMTexture*" files to "~mods" folder
	Copy the three "LocalizationDB*" files from "Localization\Real Weapon Names Global" to "~mods" folder
	For a base setup, you don't need any of the files in "Patches & addons".

	Choose either:
		Hardcore: From "A. Hardcore AIO" copy "zzzzzzz_MHM_2.0_AIO_Full_Hardcore.pak" to "~mods"
		--OR--
		Standard: From "B. Standard AIO" copy "zzzzzzz_MHM_2.0_AIO_Full_Standard.pak" to "~mods"

	You should now have 7 files in "~mods" folder


Required Mods:
	Faction Patches
		https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/721?tab=files
		Download the "FactionPatch" main file
		Copy the three "zz_FactionsPatch_Textures*" files to "~mods"

	LNA:
		https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/1212
		Download ~only~ the "1.LNA - Linxz's NPC Attachments" main file (Not needed desolation or vanilla file)
		Copy "LNA01_99_P.pak" to "~mods"

	Mutant Loot:
		https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/389
		Download the "MutantLoot" main file
		Copy the three "ZZ_Mutant_Loot_Textures_P*" files to "~mods"

	OXA:
		https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/939?tab=description
		Download the "OXA - Oxide's eXpanded Armory" main file
		Copy ~all~ files to "~mods" --EXCEPT-- the three localization files and OXA03_P.pak

	Pill Head:
		https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/778
		Dowload the "Pillhead - Substances of Stalker" main file
		Copy the three "xxxPillhead_Textures*" files to "~mods"

	Project Itemization:
		https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/445
		Download the "Project Itemization" main file
		Copy the three "ZZZ_ProjectItemization-Textures_P*" files to "~mods"

	Simple Mod Loader:
		https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/304?tab=files
		Download the "SimpleModLoader" main file
		Copy all four files from "Stalker2\Content\Paks" to "~mods"
		Mod installation instructions specify to place it in "\Paks", rather than "\Paks\~mods"
		It should work either way, and at this stage be considered a user preference.
		If you need to load a mod with "mod add /Game/Mods/~~whatever~~/ModActor.ModActor_C" and it doesn't work, you could try moving SMM to "\Paks".


Your mods folder:
	For a standard MHM AIO setup, without additional mods/addons/patches your "~mods" folder should contain the following:
		LNA01_99_P.pak
		LocalizationDB_P.pak     (from MHM_AIO, not from any other mod)
		LocalizationDB_P.ucas    (from MHM_AIO, not from any other mod)
		LocalizationDB_P.utoc    (from MHM_AIO, not from any other mod)
		MHMTextures_P.pak
		MHMTextures_P.ucas
		MHMTextures_P.utoc
		OXA0X.pak
		OXA0X.ucas
		OXA0X.utoc
		OXA01_P.pak
		OXA01_P.ucas
		OXA01_P.utoc

		ZZZ_ProjectItemization-Textures_P.utoc
		zzzzzzz_MHM_2.0_AIO_Full_Standard.pak    --OR--    zzzzzzz_MHM_2.0_AIO_Full_Hardcore.pak


Final Step:
	Press tilde(~) ingame and enter the command "mod add /Game/Mods/OXA0X/ModActor.ModActor_C" without the quotes
	Above command only needed if updating MHM setup. Shouldn't be needed for new save (but it won't hurt either)
