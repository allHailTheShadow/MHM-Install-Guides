===== MHM AIO Base Setup =====

Base setup info:
	This is my attempt to get users up and going with a baseline install of MHM AIO.
	Vortex is not recommended.
	Go slowly, take your time, don't rush it, or do it if you are tired or frustrated.
	Don't worry about adding other mods yet, until you can get the base setup up and going.
	Use a new save.
	Create "~mods" folder in "S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 Heart of Chornobyl\Stalker2\Content\Paks" if it doesn't already exist.
	If it does exist, delete anything in there, and start fresh.



CAVEAT EMPTOR:
	I have no official association or contact with the mod author.
	I really like this mod, and want it to work for everyone.
	This is simply my attempt to give people a detailed install guide.
	Its contents are quite possible WRONG.
	Feel free to correct me.



MHM AIO:
	Download the "Modular Hard Mode - AIO" file
	Copy the three "MHMTexture*" files to "~mods" folder
	Copy the three "LocalizationDB*" files from "Localization\Real Weapon Names Global" to "~mods" folder
	For a base setup, you don't need any of the files in "Patches & addons".

	Choose either:
		Hardcore: From "A. Hardcore AIO" copy "zzzzzzz_MHM_2.0_AIO_Full_Hardcore.pak" to "~mods"
		--OR--
		Standard: From "B. Standard AIO" copy "zzzzzzz_MHM_2.0_AIO_Full_Standard.pak" to "~mods"

	You should now have 7 files in "~mods" folder



Required Mods:
	Faction Patches:
		Download the "FactionPatch" main file
		Copy the three "zz_FactionsPatch_Textures*" files to "~mods"

	LNA:
		Download ~only~ the "1.LNA - Linxz's NPC Attachments" main file (Not needed desolation or vanilla file)
		Copy "LNA01_99_P.pak" to "~mods"

	Mutant Loot:
		Download the "MutantLoot" main file
		Copy the three "ZZ_Mutant_Loot_Textures_P*" files to "~mods"

	OXA:
		Download the "OXA - Oxide's eXpanded Armory" main file
		Copy ~all~ files to "~mods" --EXCEPT-- the three localization files and OXA03_P.pak

	Pill Head:
		Dowload the "Pillhead - Substances of Stalker" main file
		Copy the three "xxxPillhead_Textures*" files to "~mods"

	Project Itemization:
		Download the "Project Itemization" main file
		Copy the three "ZZZ_ProjectItemization-Textures_P*" files to "~mods"

	Simple Mod Loader:
		Download the "SimpleModLoader" main file
		Copy all four files from "Stalker2\Content\Paks" to "~mods"



For a standard MHM AIO setup, without additional mods/addons/patches your "~mods" folder should contain the following:
	LNA01_99_P.pak
	LocalizationDB_P.pak     (from MHM_AIO, not from any other mod)
	LocalizationDB_P.ucas    (from MHM_AIO, not from any other mod)
	LocalizationDB_P.utoc    (from MHM_AIO, not from any other mod)
	MHMTextures_P.pak
	MHMTextures_P.ucas
	MHMTextures_P.utoc
	OXA0X.pak
	OXA0X.ucas
	OXA0X.utoc
	OXA01_P.pak
	OXA01_P.ucas
	OXA01_P.utoc

	ZZ_Mutant_Loot_Textures_P.ucas
	ZZ_Mutant_Loot_Textures_P.utoc
	ZZZ_ProjectItemization-Textures_P.pak
	ZZZ_ProjectItemization-Textures_P.ucas
	ZZZ_ProjectItemization-Textures_P.utoc
	zzzzzzz_MHM_2.0_AIO_Full_Standard.pak __OR__ zzzzzzz_MHM_2.0_AIO_Full_Hardcore.pak



Final Step:
	Press tilde(~) ingame and enter the command "mod add /Game/Mods/OXA0X/ModActor.ModActor_C" without the quotes
	Above command only needed if updating MHM setup. Shouldn't be needed for new save (but it won't hurt either)
