06 - Other
==========
﻿	I don't know if these are recommended by the MHM author, per se, but there are compatibility patches available for these mods
	available within the MHM AIO and MHM Core Module, so they will be covered here.

	Painter of the Zone - Blood Wallmarks
		https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/99
		Download "PainteroftheZone_BetterDecal" main file.
		This one is packaged a bit differently.
		From "Manual Install\Pick from only one\I want the defaults" folder, copy the three "zz_PoZ_Blood_P*" files to "~mods".
		Choosing from the custom folders won't work, because it is the compatiblity patch provided by MHM that sets the configuration.
		DON'T copy the "zz_PoZ_BloodConfig_P.pak" file.
		Copy the file from "MHM\Patches and Addons\Patch: Painter of the Zone - Blood Wallmarks" to "~mods"

	Painter of the Zone - Bloody Wounds
		https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/394
		It seems to have no compatibility issues - no patch needed?
		Pairs well with "PotZ - Blood Wallmarks"
		Has issues with official Stalker patch 1.3
		Download "PainteroftheZone_Wounds" main file.
		Copy the three "zz_PoZWounds_P*" files to "~mods"
		Ignore the "Other Sizes" folder.

	Svarog Detector
		https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/1138
		Download "Main files" main file.
		Copy the three "Svarog_Detector_Textures_P*" to "~mods"
		DON'T copy the "Svarog_Detector_P.pak".
		Copy the file from "MHM\Patches and Addons\Patch: Svarog Detector" to "~mods"


======================
07 - Adding Other Mods
======================
	At this stage you now have a completed MHM installation. This will briefly cover adding other mods to MHM.

	IMPORTANT - Be cautious of adding mods on top of big overhauls like MHM:
	  * Adding mods that are not officially recommended are quite likely to cause issues.
	  * Adding mods that are not officially recommended are not guaranteed to be supported in the forum.
	  * Outdated mods are often a cause of issues.
	  * Other mods will most likely require some kind of compatiblity patch.
	  * Check mod description for compatibility notes.
	  * Look for compatibility patches in the MHM AIO or MHM Core to see if they exist.
	  * Look for compatibility patches on mod download page, or inside downloaded archives.
	  * Check what files the mod changes to see if it is compatible.
	  * Backup your saves. If you had stuff to your game mid-playthrough, and it turns out to be causing issues,
	    then removing it can bork your savegame.
