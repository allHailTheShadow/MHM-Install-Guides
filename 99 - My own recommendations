===== MHM My Additional Mods =====

CAUTION:
	I have no official association or contact with the mod author.
	These guides are UNOFFICIAL.


Info:
	After trawling through about a thousand mods on NexusMods, there is very little I would recommend to
	add on top of MHM and the MHM authors recommendations, because they mostly they comprise of:
		* Stuff that makes some small change that MHM already covers, but would break MHM
		* Lots of crappy performance mods, that mostly do more harm than good
		* Non-Lore-Friendly stuff
		* Lots of reshades that are very much taste dependent
		* Stuff that hasn't been updated for 1.3 patch (or even earlier versions of the game)
		* Cheat mods for carry weight, stamina, etc, that just don't fit with MHM
		* Weapon skins etc, that depend on taste but would need patches to work (would break MHM otherwise)

	Not trying to shit on mod authors, a lot of these mods are amazing, and a lot of work goes into them. It is just
	that not many of them would fit with a full MHM setup without needing patches for compatiblity and balance, etc.
	I personally feel that very little else is needed besides MHM and it's recommended mods.


Recommended:

	Flashlight Customizerï»¿
		https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/221
		Download "Flashlight_Tweaker" main file
		Copy the three "Flashlight_Customizer*" files to mods.
		Open console with '~' key ingame
		Enter command: mod add /Game/Mods/FLCustomizer/BP_MOD_FLCustomizer.BP_MOD_FLCustomizer_C
		Press "Right-Alt + L" in-game to bring up customizer menu
		You can download some kind of preset if you wish, but I just tinker with the settings until I find what felt right for me.

	STK2 - SPF
		https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/9

		********************************************************************************************
		Whether or not you use razer/chroma products, this plugin is known to cause issues.
		The file from this mod will replace it with a dummy .dll file that essentially does nothing
		when called.
		********************************************************************************************

		Get the dummy "CChromaEditorLibrary64.dll" file (only) from the "STK2 - SPF" main file
		Overwrite the original in "<gamedir>\Stalker2\Plugins\ChromaSDKPlugin\ThirdParty\Win64"
		Make a backup of the original if you wish


Somewhat recommended - depends on personal taste:

	Skip Prologue (wake up with Richter)
		https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/981
		If you have seen/played the intro one too many times...
		Copy "zzz_Skip_E01_MQ01_NoAwaken_P.pak" to "~mods"

	Performance/Optimization/FPS/Anti-lag mods:
		I was previously using a performance mod, but am now on the fence about it with the new 1.3 patch.
		I am cautious of recommending one over another, as everyone has different hardware and fps vs lag preferences.
		A lot of them change visuals too.


Somewhat Recommended
	Nice mods that have either balance or technical issues

	Stalker Faction ID
		https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/665
		Hopefully updated soon, it does have some issues getting the ID right
		Download the "Pamplemousse_StalkerId" main file.
		Copy the three "Pamplemousse_StalkerId*" files to "~mods"
		Open console with '~' key ingame
		Enter command:  mod add /Game/Mods/StalkerId/BP_StalkerIdentification.BP_StalkerIdentification_C

	Dodge
		https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/1243
		Out of the box settings are way off-balance.
		Needs adjusting to be in the spirit of MHM.
		Copy the three "Dodge*" files to "~mods"
		Change settings as per article on mod page: https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/articles/145
		Run command: mod add /Game/Mods/Dodge/ModActor.ModActor_C 

	Focus Aim
		https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/1218
		Out of the box settings are way off-balance.
		Needs adjusting to be in the spirit of MHM.
		Copy the three "FocusAim*" files to "~mods"
		Change settings as per article on mod page: https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/articles/152
		Run command: mod add /Game/Mods/FocusAim/ModActor.ModActor_C

	Grab Objects
		https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/1296
		Out of the box settings are way off-balance.
		Needs adjusting to be in the spirit of MHM.
		Copy the three "GrabObjects*" files to "~mods"
		Change settings as per article on mod page: https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/articles/154
		Run command: mod add /Game/Mods/GrabObjects/ModActor.ModActor_C

	New Game Start
		https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/1211?tab=files
		Amazing work without the official SDK.
		If you have finished the game and want a freeplay mod, this is what you are looking for.
		Have to customize install for each type of start - no ingame selector (yet)
		Needs updated compatability patch (current patch only for 2.0.5, current MHM version 2.0.8)

	Shay's - Talk and Trade To Anyone (S-TTTA)
		https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/1209
		No more "talk to the boss".
		Why not fully recommended? Needs a compatability patch if used with the S.T.F.U. mod.
		If you don't use S.T.F.U., then this mod has no issues working with MHM.

No Longer Recommended

	MinUI Suit (MinUI, MinHUD, Clean Button Prompts):
		The updated UI components of MHM 2.0.8 is all you need.
		These would now cause compatability issues.
		Nice mods though. Just not needed for MHM.
