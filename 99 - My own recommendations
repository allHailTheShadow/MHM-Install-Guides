===== MHM My Additional Mods =====

CAUTION:
	I have no official association or contact with the mod author.
	These guides are UNOFFICIAL.


Info:
	After trawling through about a thousand mods on NexusMods, there is very little I would recommend to
	add on top of MHM and the MHM authors recommendations, because they mostly they comprise of:
		* Stuff that makes some small change that MHM already covers, but would break MHM
		* Performance mods, some of them quite questionable
		* Non-Lore-Friendly stuff
		* Reshades that are very much taste dependent
		* Stuff that hasn't been updated for latest patch (not every mod needs to be, but some definately do).
		* Cheat mods for carry weight, stamina, etc, that just don't fit with MHM
		* Weapon skins etc, that depend on taste but would need patches to work (would break MHM otherwise)

	Not trying to shit on mod authors, a lot of these mods are amazing, and a lot of work goes into them. It is just
	that not many of them would fit with a full MHM setup without needing patches for compatiblity and balance, etc.
	It's really a testament to how thorough in scope the full MHM suite is.


Recommended:

	Flashlight Customizerï»¿
		https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/221
		I hate the default flashlight. I had a $5 torch from a supermarket when I was a kid that worked better.
		Download "Flashlight_Tweaker" main file
		Copy the three "Flashlight_Customizer*" files to mods.
		Open console with '~' key ingame
		Enter command: mod add /Game/Mods/FLCustomizer/BP_MOD_FLCustomizer.BP_MOD_FLCustomizer_C
		Press "Right-Alt + L" in-game to bring up customizer menu
		You can download some kind of preset if you wish, but I just tinker with the settings until I find what felt right for me.

	STK2 - SPF
		https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/9

		********************************************************************************************
		Whether or not you use razer/chroma products, this plugin is known to cause issues.
		The file from this mod will replace it with a dummy .dll file that essentially does nothing
		when called.
		********************************************************************************************

		Get the dummy "CChromaEditorLibrary64.dll" file (only) from the "STK2 - SPF" main file
		Overwrite the original in "<gamedir>\Stalker2\Plugins\ChromaSDKPlugin\ThirdParty\Win64"
		Make a backup of the original if you wish


Somewhat recommended - depends on personal taste:

	Gun Jam Swearing
		https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/900
		Compatible with everything (just replaces gun jam audio).
		Ukrainian voice only.

	Skip Prologue (wake up with Richter)
		https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/981
		If you have seen/played the intro one too many times...
		Copy "zzz_Skip_E01_MQ01_NoAwaken_P.pak" to "~mods"

	Performance/Optimization/FPS/Anti-lag mods:
		I was previously using a performance mod, but am now on the fence about it with the new 1.3 patch.
		I am cautious of recommending one over another, as everyone has different hardware and fps vs lag preferences.
		A lot of them change visuals too. Some cause crashing in certain areas.
		Feel free to try them out and see what works for you.



Somewhat Recommended - Nice mods that have balance and/or technical issues

	ART - Artifacts Reforged and Transformed
		https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/1071
		Interesting looking artifacts mod.
		Has a compatibility patch for MHM (might be outdated, check first).
		Unbalanced for MHM.
		MHM will eventually cover artifacts anyway.

	Dodge
		https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/1243
		Out of the box settings are way off-balance.
		Unbalanced for MHM.
		Copy the three "Dodge*" files to "~mods"

		Run command: mod add /Game/Mods/Dodge/ModActor.ModActor_C

		Run command: mod add /Game/Mods/GrabObjects/ModActor.ModActor_C

	New Game Start
		https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/1211?tab=files
		Amazing work without the official SDK.
		If you have finished the game and want a freeplay mod, this is what you are looking for.
		Have to customize install for each type of start - no ingame selector (yet).
		Might need updated compatibility patch
			- Current patch only for 2.0.5 (current MHM version 2.0.8)
			- Might be fine anyway 

	Shay's - Roaming Professions - Expanded Trade Inventory (S-RPETI)
		https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/1210
		Some NPCs have a trade inventory based on their profession. Low chance of 
		spawning. Trade inventory is drawn from their respective faction traders.
		Unbalanced for MHM (perhaps - not tested yet).

	Shay's - Talk and Trade To Anyone (S-TTTA)
		https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/1209
		No more "talk to the boss".
		Not compatible with the S.T.F.U. mod.

	Stalker Faction ID
		https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/665
		Hopefully updated soon, it does have some issues getting the IDs right
		Download the "Pamplemousse_StalkerId" main file.
		Copy the three "Pamplemousse_StalkerId*" files to "~mods"
		Open console with '~' key ingame
		Enter command:  mod add /Game/Mods/StalkerId/BP_StalkerIdentification.BP_StalkerIdentification_C


Not Recommended - Interesting mods that have compatibility and/or technical issues.

	Skill Magazines
		https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/1152
		Cool idea.
		Unbalanced for MHM.
		Not compatibile (localization). No patch exists.

	Artifacts Overhaul
		https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/933
		Another interesting take on artifacts.
		Unbalanced for MHM.
		Not compatibile. No patch exists.
		MHM will eventually cover artifacts anyway.

	Elemental Artifacts
		https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/1129?file_id=7705
		Another interesting take on artifacts.
		Unbalanced for MHM.
		Not compatibile. No patch exists.
		MHM will eventually cover artifacts anyway.

	Ledge Grabbing by Kennymylenny
		https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/204
		Makes puzzles too easy.
		Breaks parkour in some areas.
		Could be good with some tweaking and a merge.
		Not compatible. No patch exists.

	NPCS cant THROW
		https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/1008
		Gives a chance for enemies to miss with grenade, which will now land somewhere 
		in an adjustable radius.
		Not compatibile. No patch exists.


Untested
	These are technically compatible, but not sure how they would work overall with MHM.

	Separated helmets and armor
		https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/1111
		Balance?

	Extended Equipment
		https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/1005
		If somehow these could be moved off the head, and into armor slots, that would
		be killer.
		Balanced?


No Longer Recommended

	MinUI Suit (MinUI, MinHUD, Clean Button Prompts):
		The updated UI components of MHM 2.0.8 is all you need.
		These would now cause compatibility issues.
		Nice mods though. Just not needed for MHM.


Recommended for testing purposes for mod authors / specific stuck in game issues. Very cheaty.
	Bolt Jump       https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/1283
