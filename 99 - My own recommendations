===== MHM My Additional Mods =====

CAUTION:
	I have no official association or contact with the mod author.
	These guides are UNOFFICIAL.


Info:
	Some mods that I use that seem to work well with MHM
	These don't seem to have any conflicts, and don't require compatibility patches.


Recommended:

	Flashlight Customizerï»¿
		https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/221
		Download "Flashlight_Tweaker" main file
		Copy the three "Flashlight_Customizer*" files to mods.
		Open console with '~' key ingame
		Enter command: mod add /Game/Mods/FLCustomizer/BP_MOD_FLCustomizer.BP_MOD_FLCustomizer_C
		Press "Right-Alt + L" in-game to bring up customizer menu
		You can download some kind of preset if you wish, but I just tinker with the settings until I find what felt right for me.

	STK2 - SPF
		https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/9

		********************************************************************************************
		Whether or not you use razer/chroma products, this plugin is known to cause issues.
		The file from this mod will replace it with a dummy .dll file that essentially does nothing.
		********************************************************************************************

		Get the dummy "CChromaEditorLibrary64.dll" file (only) from the "STK2 - SPF" main file
		Overwrite the original in "<gamedir>\Stalker2\Plugins\ChromaSDKPlugin\ThirdParty\Win64"
		Make a backup of the original if you wish


Somewhat recommended - depends on personal taste:

	Skip Prologue (wake up with Richter)
		https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/981
		If you have seen/played the intro one too many times...
		Copy "zzz_Skip_E01_MQ01_NoAwaken_P.pak" to "~mods"

	Performance/Optimization/FPS/Anti-lag mods:
		I was previously using a performance mod, but am now on the fence about it with the new 1.3 patch.
		I am cautious of recommending one over another, as everyone has different hardware and fps vs lag preferences.


Somewhat Recommended - has issues:

	Stalker Faction ID
		https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/665
		Hopefully updated soon, it does have some issues getting the ID right
