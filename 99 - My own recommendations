===== MHM My Additional Mods =====

Caution:
	I have no official association or contact with the mod author.
	These guides are UNOFFICIAL.


Info:
	Some mods that I use that seem to work well with MHM
	These don't seem to have any conflicts, and don't require compatibility patches.


Recommended

	Flashlight Customizer﻿
		https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/221
		Download "Flashlight_Tweaker" main file
		Copy the three "Flashlight_Customizer*" files to mods.
		Open console with '~' key ingame
		Enter command: mod add /Game/Mods/FLCustomizer/BP_MOD_FLCustomizer.BP_MOD_FLCustomizer_C
		Press "Right-Alt + L" in-game to bring up customizer menu
		You can download some kind of preset if you wish, but I just tinker with the settings until I find what felt right for me.

	MinUI Suite - MinUI
		https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/756
		Download "MinUI" main file
		Copy the three "zzzzzzzzz_MJRamon_MinUI_P*" files to "~mods"

	MinUI Suite - MinHUD
		https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/757
		Download "MinHUD" main file
		Copy the three "zzzzzzzzz_MJRamon_MinHUD_P*" files to "~mods"

	MinUI Suite - Clean Button Prompts
		https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/758
		Download "Clean Button Prompts" main file of your choice (one or the other)
		Copy the three "zzzzzzzzz_MJRamon_CleanPromptsUI_*_P*" files to "~mods"

	Optimization/Performance mods:
		I was previously using a performance mod
		On the fence about it with new patch 1.3
		Will probably wait to see for now
		
		One thing I --DO-- recommended is getting the dummy "CChromaEditorLibrary64.dll" file (only) from "STK2 - SPF"
		Overwrite the original in "<gamedir>\Stalker2\Plugins\ChromaSDKPlugin\ThirdParty\Win64"
		Make a backup of the original if you wish
		
		Whether or not you have/use Razer Chroma products, the plugin is known to cause issues.

Somewhat Recommended
	Stalker Faction ID﻿﻿
		Hopefully updated soon, it does have some issues getting the ID right
		Download the "Pamplemousse_StalkerId" main file.
		Copy the three "Pamplemousse_StalkerId*" files to "~mods"
		Open console with '~' key ingame
		Eter command:  mod add /Game/Mods/StalkerId/BP_StalkerIdentification.BP_StalkerIdentification_C


Not-Recommended but interesting none-the-less:
	Been looking at mods by rbwadle:
		Download main files and install as normal.
		Also run console command to activate.
		
		A bit cheaty, but might fit with some tweaking of the settings:
			Dodge           mod add /Game/Mods/Dodge/ModActor.ModActor_C
			Focus Aim       mod add /Game/Mods/FocusAim/ModActor.ModActor_C
			Grab Objects    mod add /Game/Mods/GrabObjects/ModActor.ModActor_C

		Definately VERY cheaty, not recommended, could be useful for testing:
			Bolt Jump       mod add /Game/Mods/BoltJump/ModActor.ModActor_C
			Locksmith       mod add /Game/Mods/Locksmith/ModActor.ModActor_C
			Teleport        mod add /Game/Mods/Teleport2/ModActor.ModActor_C
			
		Not needed:
			Night Vision    Already implemented by OXA, so no
