=========
01 - Info
=========
	This information was presented in part 3, but bears repeating here.

	IMPORTANT - Be cautious of adding mods on top of big overhauls like MHM:
	  * Adding mods that are not officially recommended are quite likely to cause issues.
	  * Adding mods that are not officially recommended are not guaranteed to be supported in the forum.
	  * Other mods will most likely require some kind of compatiblity patch.
	  * Check mod description for compatibility notes.
	  * Look for compatibility patches in the MHM AIO or MHM Core to see if they exist.
	  * Look for compatibility patches on mod download pages, or inside downloaded archives.
	  * Check what files the mod changes to see if it is compatible.
	  * Backup your saves. If you add stuff to your game mid-playthrough, and it turns out to be causing issues,
	    then removing it can bork your savegame.

02 - Recommended
================
	Flashlight Customizer﻿
		https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/221
		I hate the default flashlight. I had a $5 torch from a supermarket when I was a kid that worked better.
		Download "Flashlight_Tweaker" main file
		Copy the three "Flashlight_Customizer*" files to mods.
		Open console with '~' key ingame
		Enter command: mod add /Game/Mods/FLCustomizer/BP_MOD_FLCustomizer.BP_MOD_FLCustomizer_C
		Press "Right-Alt + L" in-game to bring up customizer menu
		You can download some kind of preset if you wish, but I just tinker with the settings until I find what felt right for me.

	Improved Saves Modular
		https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/1315
		Vast improvement over the number of saves allowed, and the behaviour thereof.
		INCOMPATIBLE WITH MASTER-MODE/CAMPFIRE-ADDON

	STK2 - SPF    <-- Only for CChromaEditorLibrary64.dll replacement
		https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/9

		********************************************************************************************
		Whether or not you use razer/chroma products, this plugin is known to cause issues.
		The file from this mod will replace it with a dummy .dll file that essentially does nothing
		when called.
		********************************************************************************************

		Get the dummy "CChromaEditorLibrary64.dll" file (only) from the "STK2 - SPF" main file
		Overwrite the original in "<gamedir>\Stalker2\Plugins\ChromaSDKPlugin\ThirdParty\Win64"
		Make a backup of the original if you wish


===========================================
03 - Somewhat Recommended (User Preference)
===========================================
	Gun Jam Swearing
		https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/900
		Compatible with everything (just replaces gun jam audio).
		Ukrainian voice only.

	Skip Prologue (wake up with Richter)
		https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/981
		If you have seen/played the intro one too many times...
		Copy "zzz_Skip_E01_MQ01_NoAwaken_P.pak" to "~mods"
		INCOMPATIBLE WITH MASTER-MODE/CAMPFIRE-ADDON

	Performance/Optimization/FPS/Anti-lag mods:
		* There are a great variety of these.
		* Depending on your hardware, some may or may not be useful.
		* Some of them change the visuals.
		* Some increase fps at the cost of lag, or vice-versa.
		* Some cause crashes and other weird shit.
		* Feel free to try them out and see what works for you.
		* I am cautious of recommending one over another, as user results may vary.


========================================================
04 - Somewhat Recommended (Has Balance/Technical Issues)
========================================================
	ART - Artifacts Reforged and Transformed
		https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/1071
		Interesting looking artifacts mod.
		Has a compatibility patch for MHM (might be outdated, check first).
		Unbalanced for MHM.
		MHM will eventually cover artifacts anyway.

	Dodge
		https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/1243
		Out of the box settings are way off-balance.
		Unbalanced for MHM.
		Copy the three "Dodge*" files to "~mods"
		Change settings as per article on mod page: https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/articles/145
		Run command: mod add /Game/Mods/Dodge/ModActor.ModActor_C 

	Focus Aim
		https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/1218
		Out of the box settings are way off-balance.
		Unbalanced for MHM.
		Copy the three "FocusAim*" files to "~mods"
		Change settings as per article on mod page: https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/articles/152
		Run command: mod add /Game/Mods/FocusAim/ModActor.ModActor_C

	Grab Objects
		https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/1296
		Out of the box settings are way off-balance.
		Unbalanced for MHM.
		Copy the three "GrabObjects*" files to "~mods"
		Change settings as per article on mod page: https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/articles/154
		Run command: mod add /Game/Mods/GrabObjects/ModActor.ModActor_C

	New Game Start
		https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/1211
		Amazing work without the official SDK.
		If you have finished the game and want a freeplay mod, this is what you are looking for.
		Have to customize install for each type of start - no ingame selector (yet).
		INCLUDED COMPATIBILITY PATCH HAS BEEN UPDATED FOR LATEST MHM
		INCOMPATIBLE WITH MASTER-MODE/CAMPFIRE-ADDON

	Shay's Roaming Professions
		https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/1210
		Some NPCs have a trade inventory based on their profession. Low chance of 
		spawning. Trade inventory is drawn from their respective faction traders.
		Unbalanced for MHM
		REQUIRES SHAY'S TTA (and is therefore incompatible with S.T.F.U.)

	Shay's Talk and Trade To Anyone
		https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/1209
		No more "talk to the boss".
		Not compatible with the S.T.F.U. mod.

	Stalker Faction ID
		https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/665
		Hopefully updated soon, it does have some issues getting the IDs right
		Download the "Pamplemousse_StalkerId" main file.
		Copy the three "Pamplemousse_StalkerId*" files to "~mods"
		Open console with '~' key ingame
		Enter command:  mod add /Game/Mods/StalkerId/BP_StalkerIdentification.BP_StalkerIdentification_C


=========================================================
05 - Not Recommended (Has Compatibility/Technical Issues)
=========================================================
	Artifacts Overhaul
		https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/933
		Another interesting take on artifacts.
		Unbalanced for MHM.
		Not compatibile. No patch exists.
		MHM will eventually cover artifacts anyway.

	Elemental Artifacts
		https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/1129
		Another interesting take on artifacts.
		Unbalanced for MHM.
		Not compatibile. No patch exists.
		MHM will eventually cover artifacts anyway.

	Ledge Grabbing
		https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/204
		Makes puzzles too easy.
		Breaks parkour in some areas.
		Could be good with some tweaking and a merge.
		Not compatible. No patch exists.

	NPCS cant THROW
		https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/1008
		Gives a chance for enemies to miss with grenade, which will now land somewhere 
		in an adjustable radius.
		Not compatibile. No patch exists.

	Skill Magazines
		https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/1152
		Cool idea.
		Unbalanced for MHM.
		Not compatibile (localization). No patch exists.


=============
06 - Untested
=============
	These are technically compatible, but not sure how they would work overall with MHM.
	They also require a seperate mod loader. Might be kinda janky.

	Separated helmets and armor
		https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/1111
		Balanced?

	Extended Equipment
		https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/1005
		If somehow these could be moved off the head, and into armor slots, that would be killer.
		Balanced?


==========================
07 - No Longer Recommended
==========================
	Don't forget to endorse if you used and enjoyed them.

	MinUI Suit (MinUI, MinHUD, Clean Button Prompts):
		The updated UI components of MHM 2.0.8 is all you need.
		These would now cause compatibility issues.
		Nice mods though. Just not needed for MHM.
